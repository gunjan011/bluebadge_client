             <p>I carry your heart with me<br></br>(I carry it in
my heart)<br></br>I am never without it(anywhere<br></br>
I go you go,my dear; and whatever is done<br></br>
by only me is your doing,my darling)<br></br>
I fear no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)<br></br>I want
no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)<br></br>
and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant<br></br>
and whatever a sun will always sing is you<br></br>
here is the deepest secret nobody knows<br></br>
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;<br></br>which grows
higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)<br></br>
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart
<br></br>
<br></br>
I carry your heart(I carry it in my heart)</p>
