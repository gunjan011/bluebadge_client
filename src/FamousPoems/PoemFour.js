             <h4>Emily Dickinson</h4><br></br>
             <p>Hope is the thing with feathers  <br></br>
That perches in the soul,<br></br> 
And sings the tune without the words,<br></br>
And never stops at all,<br></br>
 <br></br>  
And sweetest in the gale is heard;<br></br>          
And sore must be the storm  <br></br>
That could abash the little bird <br></br> 
That kept so many warm.  <br></br>
 <br></br>  
Iâ€™ve heard it in the chillest land, <br></br> 
And on the strangest sea;<br></br>       
Yet, never, in extremity,<br></br>  
It asked a crumb of me.</p>
         </div>
