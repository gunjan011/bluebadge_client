             <h2>I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud</h2><br></br>
             <h4>William Wordsworth</h4><br></br>
             <p>I wandered lonely as a cloud<br></br>
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,<br></br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br></br>
A host, of golden daffodils;<br></br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br></br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br></br>
<br></br>
Continuous as the stars that shine<br></br>
And twinkle on the milky way,<br></br>
They stretched in never-ending line<br></br>
Along the margin of a bay:<br></br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br></br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br></br>
<br></br>
The waves beside them danced; but they<br></br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br></br>
A poet could not but be gay,<br></br>
In such a jocund company:<br></br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br></br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br></br>
<br></br>
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br></br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br></br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br></br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br></br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br></br>
And dances with the daffodils.
